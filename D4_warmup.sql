Good morning. Working on this.

Good morning all, here's today's warmup. For this one, there is no dataset we're working with here,
so you have to look at the structure of the two tables, and come up with the query "by hand"
(write/type it out).
HINTS:
For this question, be sure to write the query to include users who made no comments in January 2019.
Assume the the formate for the dates is "YYYY-MM-DD"
Assume for this histogram, the "bin size" for comments is 1, ie users will be counted together only
if they made the exact same number of comments in January 2019 (as opposed to a range of counts).
Soooo... if there were three users with comment counts respectively of 8, 11, 8, the output should
give a count of 2 for the value of 8 comments and 1 for a value of 11 comments.
For inspiration and checking your syntax, you could try a similar query on databased you have
installed (eg. dvd_rental, northwind), and then translate that to this problem.
For further inspiration, you can look at the videos I sent out last night.
FINALLY, put your work/answer (including psuedo-code if you'd like) in a github repo and send it to
Sean and I.

And if anyone feels super confident with their answer and still has extra some time, can you modify
the query to have bin width's (ie user's with 10-12 comments, 13-15 comments, etc, are counted together (definitely not necessary for this morning, definitely extra challenging).
